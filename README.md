## supernova - use novaclient with multiple nova environments the easy way

![First world problems - nova style](http://lolcdn.mhtx.net/firstworldproblems-multiplenovaenvironments-20120316-072224.jpg)

You may like *supernova* if you regularly have the following problems:

* You hate trying to source multiple novarc files when using novaclient
* You get your terminals confused and do the wrong things in the wrong nova environment
* You don't like remembering things

If any of these complaints ring true, *supernova* is for you. *supernova* manages multiple nova environments without sourcing novarc's or mucking with environment variables.

### Installation

    git clone git://github.com/rackerhacker/supernova.git
    cd supernova
    python setup.py install

### Configuration

For *supernova* to work properly, each environment must be defined in `~/.supernova` (in your user's home directory).  The data in the file is exactly the same as the environment variables which you would normally use when running novaclient.  You can copy/paste from your novarc files directly into configuration sections within `~/.supernova`.

Here's an example of two environments, **production** and **development**:

    [production]
    NOVA_URL=http://production.nova.example.com:8774/v1.1/
    NOVA_VERSION=1.1
    NOVA_USERNAME = jsmith
    NOVA_API_KEY = fd62afe2-4686-469f-9849-ceaa792c55a6
    NOVA_PROJECT_ID = nova-production

    [development]
    NOVA_URL=http://dev.nova.example.com:8774/v1.1/
    NOVA_VERSION=1.1
    NOVA_USERNAME = jsmith
    NOVA_API_KEY = 40318069-6069-4d9f-836d-a46df17fc8d1
    NOVA_PROJECT_ID = nova-production

When you use *supernova*, you'll refer to these environments as **production** and **development**.  Every environment is specified by its configuration header name.

### Usage

    supernova [--debug] [environment] [novaclient arguments...]

For example, if you wanted to run a list in the **production** environment:

    supernova production list

Show a particular instance's data in the preprod environment:

    supernova preprod show 3edb6dac-5a75-486a-be1b-3b15fd5b4ab0a

The first argument is generally the environment argument and it is expected to be a single word without spaces. Any text after the environment argument is passed directly to novaclient.

You may optionally pass `--debug` as the first argument (before the environment argument) to inject the `NOVACLIENT_DEBUG=1` option into the process environment to see additional debug information about the requests being made to the API:

    supernova --debug production list

As before, any text after the environment argument is passed directly to novaclient:

#### A brief note about environment variables

*supernova* will only replace and/or append environment variables to the already present variables for the duration of the novaclient executation. If you have `NOVA_USERNAME` set outside the script, it won't be used in the script since the script will pull data from `~/.supernova` and use it to run novaclient. In addition, any variables which are set prior to running *supernova* will be left unaltered when the script exits.
